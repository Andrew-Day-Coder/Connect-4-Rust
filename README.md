# Connect 4 With an implemation of Minimax

* Mildly functioning version of connect 4
* Has an implementation of minimax
* Has implementation of alpha-beta-pruning with minimax

## Flaws

 Cannot really see far enough ahead, in a reasonable amount of time.
Pit the minimax algorithm against itself to see it fall into the same trap every time.

### To Do

* If the algorithm believes that it is going to lose then it should try to delay the loss
* Definitely needs some usability improvements.
